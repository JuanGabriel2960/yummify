# :construction_worker: Installation

**You need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) & [Android SDK](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) first, then in order to clone the project via HTTPS, run this command:**

```git clone https://github.com/JuanGabriel2960/yummify.git```

Or via SSH:

```git clone git@github.com:JuanGabriel2960/yummify.git```

**Install dependencies**

```yarn install```

# :rocket: Getting Started

### `npx react-native start`

Start the Metro console bundler, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native. Metro "takes in an entry file and various options, and returns a single JavaScript file that includes all your code and its dependencies."

### `npx react-native run-android`

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal inside the React Native project folder and run npx react-native run-android. If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android emulator shortly.
